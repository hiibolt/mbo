## AI Usage
I used Claude Opus 4.1 for dense, difficult tasks requiring heavy verification and Claude Sonnet 4.5 for less intense tasks such as test verification, by-line documentation, and rapid templating.

List of usage:
- Moving example `databento` code to use more verbose `anyhow` reporting
    - A simple matter of asking it to inspect and replace all `unwrap` and `expect` calls
