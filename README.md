## Steps Chosen
I chose to do all four major targets.

I started with **Order Book Reconstruction** to gain a better understanding of how the library worked, as it looked to be the most difficult comparatively. I was correct in this thought, and succeeded as a result.
- 1. **Boilerplate**: Approx. 5-10m to select a stack and solid dependency foundation.
- 2. **Order Book Reconstruction**: Approx.

## AI Usage
I used Claude Opus 4.1 for dense, difficult tasks requiring heavy verification and Claude Sonnet 4.5 for less intense tasks such as test verification, by-line documentation, and rapid templating.

List of usage:
- Moving example `databento` code to use more verbose `anyhow` reporting
    - A simple matter of asking it to inspect and replace all `unwrap` and `expect` calls
